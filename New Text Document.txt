Roger Federer and Nadal played each other from 2004 to 2019, and their rivalry was a significant part of both men's careers.[381][382][383] They held the top two rankings on the ATP Tour from July 2005 to 14 August 2009,[384] and again from 11 September 2017 to 15 October 2018. They are the only pair of men to be consistently ranked in the Top 2 for four years continuously (from July 2005 to August 2009).[385][386] Nadal ascended to No. 2 in July 2005 and held this spot for a record 160 consecutive weeks before surpassing Federer in August 2008.[387] Nadal and Federer are also the only pair of men to have ever finished six consecutive calendar years at the top 2 positions (from 2005 to 2010).[388]

Nadal and Federer faced each other 40 times, with Nadal leading 24–16 overall and 10–4 in Grand Slam matches. Nadal had a winning record on clay (14–2) and outdoor hard courts (8–6), while Federer led on indoor hard courts (5–1) and grass (3–1).[389]

24 of their matches were in tournament finals, including a joint-record nine major finals (tied with Djokovic–Nadal).[113] From 2006 to 2008, they played in every French Open and Wimbledon final, and also met in the title matches of the 2009 Australian Open, the 2011 French Open and the 2017 Australian Open.[113] Nadal won six of the nine, losing the first two Wimbledon finals and 2017 in Australia. Four of these matches were five-set matches (2007 and 2008 Wimbledon, 2009 and 2017 Australian Open), and the 2008 Wimbledon final has been lauded as the greatest match ever.[118][390][391][392] Nadal was the only player to defeat Federer in the final of a major on all three surfaces (grass, hard court, and clay).
